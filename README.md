## STRING AND METHODS

Those are the string and its methos, those are exercises from programming fundamentals.


### TOOLS:

1. CLASS Strings  and its methods: chatAt(), substring(), indexOf(), equals(), length().
2. App class: menu, 
3. Method main: initialize class Scanner and call method manu.
4. Method menu, control Code Structure: switch to functions
3. Switch to functions:
    * compare2stirngs(Scanner scan): Class System, Class Scanner, Contro Code Structure If.
    * countCharacters(Scanner scan): Class System, Class Scanner, Contro Code Structure If, iterative control structures for loop.
    * reverseString(Scanner scan).
    * subStrings(Scanner scan).
    * printPosition(Scanner scan).
    * strReversed(Scanner scan).
    * charGame(Scanner scan): one-line print condition, Class string method substring and concatenation.
